# LL MiniProject 5: Duplicate Question Detection

Mini-project with alotted time of one day. Using NLP processing methods and different supervised learning models to solve the Quora duplicate question problem. One-day long mini-project where I focused on comparing different ML models, specifically implementing a basic LSTM. 

Two different work flows were followed for traditional ML algorithms versus an LSTM Neural Net. The traditional workflow and models can be found in the `Code.ipynb`.  The resulting confusion matrices from the different traditional models can be found in the `confusion_matrix` folder. The LSTM processing and model training can be found in `LSTM.ipynb`. The LSTM implementation is heavily based off this [excellent project](https://github.com/jyu-theartofml/kaggle_quora) by [jyu-theartofml](https://github.com/jyu-theartofml).

To run the files, download the `big_files.zip` from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bHH7v0MunVb3KPDgsprU5wzbQIWUcVSz/view?usp=sharing) and save the extracted folder into the directory above this repo's directory.
